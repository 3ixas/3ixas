#### Currently working on...
...a backend-focused learning roadmap covering C#, Java, Python, system design, clean architecture, and high-performance engineering — with a focus on real-world impact and long-term growth.

#### Outside of tech...
...you’ll find me playing football, lifting weights, going on runs, learning about periods or events in history (currently exploring Ancient Egypt), or reading epic fantasy (currently deep into *A Game Of Thrones*).
